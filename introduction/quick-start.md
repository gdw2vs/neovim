# Quick start

The briefest of summary on how to get started with Neovim and Clojure development.  See the [install section](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/install/) for full details.

* [Install Neovim 7 or greater](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
* Install supporting tools
    * node.js for Treesitter,
    * ripgrep to search for files (used by telescope)
* [Clone Neovim Config](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/nvim-fennel-lsp-conjure-as-clojure-ide)
* Run `:PackerInstall` in Neovim
* [Install Clojure CLI](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/install/) (or Leiningen)
* [Run a Clojure REPL process](/repl-driven-development/) - in a separate terminal session
* Open a Clojure file in Neovim - Conjure will automatically connect

Then [learn how to use Neovim](/neovim-basics/) and how to [use Conjure for REPL driven development](/repl-driven-development/conjure.html)
