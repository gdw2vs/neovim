# Version Control

There are several ways to interact with Git version control

* Neogit git client (similar to Emacs Magit)
* Octo for GitHub Issue and Pull Requests
* Shell out to command line
* Neovim terminal buffer
* Fugitive

> fugitive package provides a command line experience (no keybinding)


!!! HINT "Run Git Status"
    `SPC g s` opens Git Status tab, by running `:Neogit`
