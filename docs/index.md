![Neovim with Fennel configuration for Clojure developers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/editors/neovim/screenshots/neovim-clojure-development-tree-whichkey.png)

Neovim is a highly extensible and powerful editor, supporting mult-modal editing and Vim-style key bindings.  Packages are added via Packer to provide a [rich set of features](introduction/features.md) for Clojure development and general editing

Practicalli Neovim provides an install guide and a simple, powerful and fun [REPL Driven Development workflow](introduction/repl-workflow.md)
