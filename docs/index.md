## Neovim and Clojure development

Neovim is a highly extensible and powerful editor, supporting mult-modal editing and Vim-style key bindings.  Packages are added via Packer to provide a [rich set of features](introduction/features.md) for Clojure development and general editing

Practicalli Neovim provides an install guide and a simple, powerful and fun [REPL Driven Development workflow](repl-workflow.md)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/neovim-config-redux.git
```

> [Install pages](install/index.md) detail the resources and recommended approaches to installing Neovim, Neovim packages, Java, Clojure, terminals, fonts and supporting tools
