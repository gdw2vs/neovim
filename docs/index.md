## Neovim and Clojure development

Neovim is a highly extensible and powerful editor, supporting mult-modal editing and Vim-style key bindings.  Packages are added via Packer to provide a [rich set of features](introduction/features.md) for Clojure development and general editing

Practicalli Neovim provides an install guide and a simple, powerful and fun [REPL Driven Development workflow](repl-workflow.md)
