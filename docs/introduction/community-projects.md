Practicalli Neovim book covers the following configurations:

- [Practicalli Neovim Config Redux](https://github.com/practicalli/neovim-config-redux) currently provides a configuration for this book, there are many interesting alternatives.
- [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) and [Practicalli AstroNvim Config](https://github.com/practicalli/astronvim-config) organised configuration with a polished UI aimed at Neovim 9 with Treesitter support, using Lazy for packages and  Mason for LSP components


## Alternative configurations

Practicalli Neovim does not cover the following Community configurations.

- [Magit Kit](https://github.com/Olical/magic-kit) fennel configuration from the author of Conjure
- [cajus-nvim](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/cajus-nvim) inspiration for practicalli/neovim-config-redux
- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) lazy & mason configuration
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) polished UI with Lazy optomisations

!!! INFO "Long term project: Fennel config with AstroNvim-like UI experience"
    A very long term goal for Practicalli is to create a Neovim configuration written predominatly in Fennel, providing a rich user experience on par with the very polished experience of AstroNvim.

    Lazy and Mason should be used to manage packages and tools (LSP & DAP servers, lint & format tools).

    Which-key should provide a mnemonic menu system similar to the Spacemacs experience.
