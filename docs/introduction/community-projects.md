# Community Configuration Projects

Whilst practicalli/neovim-config-redux currently provides a configuration for this book, there are many interesting alternatives.

- [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) very polished UI with Neovim 9 & Treesitter support, using Lazy for packages and  Mason for LSP components
- [Magit Kit](https://github.com/Olical/magic-kit) fennel configuration from the author of Conjure
- [cajus-nvim](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/cajus-nvim) inspiration for practicalli/neovim-config-redux
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)

!!! INFO "Fennel config with AstroNvim-like UI experience"
    A very long term goal for Practicalli is to create a Neovim configuration written predominatly in Fennel, providing a rich user experience on par with the very polished experience of AstroNvim.

    Lazy and Mason should be used to manage packages and tools (LSP & DAP servers, lint & format tools).

    Which-key should provide a mnemonic menu system similar to the Spacemacs experience.
